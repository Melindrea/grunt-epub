## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.4`

If you haven't used [Grunt][grunt] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][Getting Started] guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-epub --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-epub');
```
